## Api

Creating an object of promise:


```javascript
var promise = new ipromise();
```

... or ...

```javascript
var promise = ipromise();
```


Api for end user:


```javascript

promise
    .done(function(fn, fn, fn ,[fn, fn], fn, ...){
        // action on done
    })
    .fail(function(fn, fn, fn ,[fn, fn], fn, ...){
        // action on fail
    })
    .always(function(fn, fn, fn ,[fn, fn], fn, ...){
        // action on done and on fail
    })
    .progress(function(fn, fn, fn ,[fn, fn], fn, ...){
        // action on progress
    });

```


Api for promise provider:

if you want o to resolve promise:


```javascript
promise.resolve(arg1, arg2, ...)
```


if you want o to reject promise:


```javascript
promise.reject(arg1, arg2, ...)
```

if you want o to trigger progress (trigger only before change state, after state is changed no more progress events are triggered)


```javascript
promise.notify(arg1, arg2, ...)
```



.. and of course method "then":

```javascript

var promise2 = promise.then(
    function done(arg1, arg2, ...){}, 
    function fail(arg1, arg2, ...){}
);

```
